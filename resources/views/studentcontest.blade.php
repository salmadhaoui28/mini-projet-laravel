    Students presented their papers on Thursday May 18 during the 
    <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="program.php">Student Contest Sessions</a> 
    and responded to questions from the audience. 
    After the end of the Sessions, a poll was conducted, where JURSE 2023 
    participants could select the best paper, contributing to the Contest result. 
    The result was announced during the <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="social-events.php">Gala Dinner</a> and the Best Student Contest 
    Paper Awards were granted to Patricia Glocke and Giannis Lantzanakis.
